@article{novickHighbandwidthDensitySilicon2023,
  abstract   = {The growth of artificial intelligence applications demands ever larger and more complex deep learning models, dominating today's—and tomorrow's—data center and high-performance computing systems. While traditional electronics are failing to keep pace with application demands, silicon photonic (SiPh) interconnects have emerged as a necessary technology to support these systems. SiPh-driven wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) offers a particularly promising path toward supporting incredibly high-aggregate link bandwidth in a compact and efficient form factor. One of the basic building blocks of these integrated WDM interconnects is the SiPh resonator. Their inherent wavelength selectivity and compact footprint allow for efficient data transmission multiplexed across dozens of carrier wavelengths. Used as add-drop (AD) filters, SiPh resonators are critical to constructing integrated tunable wavelength-selective optical circuit switches as well as for demultiplexing the different carrier wavelengths toward independent wavelength-insensitive photodiodes in a dense wavelength-division multiplexing receiver. Resonators in the all-pass (AP) configuration are widespread as well, allowing for wavelength-selective modulation to drive aggregate link bandwidths far beyond the individual channel data rate. Unlike SiPh Mach–Zehnder modulators (MZM), resonant modulators can be driven using low, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor drive voltages, allowing for tight co-integration between photonic integrated circuits, fabricated with larger process node technologies, and electronic integrated circuits, designed to exploit the advantages of the latest node. To push toward practical peta-scale interconnects, a comprehensive review of SiPh resonators is required, addressing bottlenecks and design constraints at both the architecture and device levels. We first describe the predominant integrated link architectures and identify their limits. We then discuss the device-level design considerations that can be made for both AD and AP configuration resonators to overcome the system level limits with novel resonator device designs. Analytical models and numerical simulation of resonators are validated by experimental measurement of devices fabricated in a commercial 300-mm foundry, showing a clear path toward volume manufacturing. The demonstrated resonant modulators and filters support the feasibility of increasing the aggregate bandwidth of resonator-driven SiPh interconnects into the peta-scale regime.},

@article{parsonsUndercut,
  abstract  = {Silicon photonic devices are fundamental to high-density wavelength-division multiplexed (DWDM) optical links and photonic switching networks, such as resonant modulators and Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZIs), and are highly sensitive to fabrication variations and operational temperature swings. However, thermal tuning to compensate for fabrication and operational temperature variations can result in prohibitive power consumption, challenging the scalability of energy-efficient photonic integrated circuits (PICs). In this work, we develop and demonstrate a wafer-scale thermal undercut process in a 300 mm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) foundry that dramatically improves the thermal isolation of thermo-optic devices by selectively removing substrate material beneath the waveguides and resonators. This approach significantly reduces the power required for thermal tuning across multiple device architectures, achieving almost a 5\$\${\textbackslash}times\$\$improvement in tuning efficiency in a state-of-the-art 4.5 \$\${\textbackslash}upmu\$\$m radius microdisk modulator and a 40\$\${\textbackslash}times\$\$improvement in efficiency for a MZI phase shifter. To the best of the authors' knowledge, we demonstrate the first wafer-scale comparison of non-undercut and undercut silicon photonic devices using comprehensive wafer-scale measurements across 64 reticles of a 300 mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. Further, we demonstrate a comprehensive wafer-scale analysis of the influence of undercut trench opening geometry on device tuning efficiency. Notably, we observe highly uniform performance across the full 300 mm wafer for multiple device types, emphasizing that our process can be scaled to large-scale photonic circuits with high yield. These results open new opportunities for large-scale integrated photonic circuits using thermo-optic devices, paving the way for scalable, low-power silicon photonic systems.},

@article{robinsonSiliconPhotonicDWDM2025,
  abstract      = {Silicon photonic dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) links based on microresonators are a leading candidate for scaling optical interconnects in high-performance computing. However, fabrication-induced variations in resonant frequencies, free spectral ranges (FSRs), and thermal tuning efficiencies necessitate robust initialization strategies to align resonators with multi-wavelength laser sources. While many prior studies examine individual devices, comprehensive wafer-scale statistical analyses---and their implications for initialization algorithms remain scarce. Here, we report measurements from more than 4,600 fabricated resonators, including microdisks, tapered hybrid-bend (THB) racetracks, and microrings, fabricated on 300-mm wafers. We show that microrings exhibit the largest variation, while microdisks are significantly more uniform. Using these distributions, we evaluate initialization performance through Monte Carlo simulations of two widely used algorithms: barrel-shifting and global-search. Our results establish a clear tradeoff: barrel-shifting offers sub-millisecond initialization with modest power budgets for low-variation devices (e.g. microdisks), whereas global search, though approximately 300 times slower, achieves substantially lower power consumption for high-variation devices (e.g. microrings). This work provides the first wafer-scale statistical framework linking resonator variability to initialization outcomes, and offers practical design guidance for selecting initialization strategies that balance speed, power, and robustness.},
