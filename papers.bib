@article{novickHighbandwidthDensitySilicon2023,
  abstract   = {The growth of artificial intelligence applications demands ever larger and more complex deep learning models, dominating today's—and tomorrow's—data center and high-performance computing systems. While traditional electronics are failing to keep pace with application demands, silicon photonic (SiPh) interconnects have emerged as a necessary technology to support these systems. SiPh-driven wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) offers a particularly promising path toward supporting incredibly high-aggregate link bandwidth in a compact and efficient form factor. One of the basic building blocks of these integrated WDM interconnects is the SiPh resonator. Their inherent wavelength selectivity and compact footprint allow for efficient data transmission multiplexed across dozens of carrier wavelengths. Used as add-drop (AD) filters, SiPh resonators are critical to constructing integrated tunable wavelength-selective optical circuit switches as well as for demultiplexing the different carrier wavelengths toward independent wavelength-insensitive photodiodes in a dense wavelength-division multiplexing receiver. Resonators in the all-pass (AP) configuration are widespread as well, allowing for wavelength-selective modulation to drive aggregate link bandwidths far beyond the individual channel data rate. Unlike SiPh Mach–Zehnder modulators (MZM), resonant modulators can be driven using low, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor drive voltages, allowing for tight co-integration between photonic integrated circuits, fabricated with larger process node technologies, and electronic integrated circuits, designed to exploit the advantages of the latest node. To push toward practical peta-scale interconnects, a comprehensive review of SiPh resonators is required, addressing bottlenecks and design constraints at both the architecture and device levels. We first describe the predominant integrated link architectures and identify their limits. We then discuss the device-level design considerations that can be made for both AD and AP configuration resonators to overcome the system level limits with novel resonator device designs. Analytical models and numerical simulation of resonators are validated by experimental measurement of devices fabricated in a commercial 300-mm foundry, showing a clear path toward volume manufacturing. The demonstrated resonant modulators and filters support the feasibility of increasing the aggregate bandwidth of resonator-driven SiPh interconnects into the peta-scale regime.},
