@article{novickHighbandwidthDensitySilicon2023,
  abstract = {The growth of artificial intelligence applications demands ever larger and more complex deep learning models, dominating today's—and tomorrow's—data center and high-performance computing systems. While traditional electronics are failing to keep pace with application demands, silicon photonic (SiPh) interconnects have emerged as a necessary technology to support these systems. SiPh-driven wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) offers a particularly promising path toward supporting incredibly high-aggregate link bandwidth in a compact and efficient form factor. One of the basic building blocks of these integrated WDM interconnects is the SiPh resonator. Their inherent wavelength selectivity and compact footprint allow for efficient data transmission multiplexed across dozens of carrier wavelengths. Used as add-drop (AD) filters, SiPh resonators are critical to constructing integrated tunable wavelength-selective optical circuit switches as well as for demultiplexing the different carrier wavelengths toward independent wavelength-insensitive photodiodes in a dense wavelength-division multiplexing receiver. Resonators in the all-pass (AP) configuration are widespread as well, allowing for wavelength-selective modulation to drive aggregate link bandwidths far beyond the individual channel data rate. Unlike SiPh Mach–Zehnder modulators (MZM), resonant modulators can be driven using low, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor drive voltages, allowing for tight co-integration between photonic integrated circuits, fabricated with larger process node technologies, and electronic integrated circuits, designed to exploit the advantages of the latest node. To push toward practical peta-scale interconnects, a comprehensive review of SiPh resonators is required, addressing bottlenecks and design constraints at both the architecture and device levels. We first describe the predominant integrated link architectures and identify their limits. We then discuss the device-level design considerations that can be made for both AD and AP configuration resonators to overcome the system level limits with novel resonator device designs. Analytical models and numerical simulation of resonators are validated by experimental measurement of devices fabricated in a commercial 300-mm foundry, showing a clear path toward volume manufacturing. The demonstrated resonant modulators and filters support the feasibility of increasing the aggregate bandwidth of resonator-driven SiPh interconnects into the peta-scale regime.},

@article{brianJOCN,
  abstract  = {The increasing size and complexity of deep learning (DL) models have led to the wide adoption of distributed training methods in datacenters (DCs) and high-performance computing (HPC) systems. However, communication among distributed computing units (CUs) has emerged as a major bottleneck in the training process. In this study, we propose Flex-SiPAC, a flexible silicon photonic accelerated compute cluster designed to accelerate multi-tenant distributed DL training workloads. Flex-SiPAC takes a co-design approach that combines a silicon photonic hardware platform with a tailored collective algorithm, optimized to leverage the unique physical properties of the architecture. The hardware platform integrates a novel wavelength-reconfigurable transceiver design and a micro-resonator-based wavelength-reconfigurable switch, enabling the system to achieve flexible bandwidth steering in the wavelength domain. The collective algorithm is designed to support reconfigurable topologies, enabling efficient all-reduce communications that are commonly used in DL training. The feasibility of the Flex-SiPAC architecture is demonstrated through two testbed experiments. First, an optical testbed experiment demonstrates the flexible routing of wavelengths by shuffling an array of input wavelengths using a custom-designed spatial-wavelength selective switch. Second, a four-GPU testbed running two DL workloads shows a 23\% improvement in job completion time compared to a similarly sized leaf-spine topology. We further evaluate Flex-SiPAC using large-scale simulations, which show that Flex-SiPAC is able to reduce the communication time by 26\% to 29\% compared to state-of-the-art compute clusters under representative collective operations.},
