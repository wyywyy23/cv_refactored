\boxLevelOne{
    My research centers on enabling the design of system connectivity that is ultra high-bandwidth, energy-efficient, and adaptable in today's data-driven world. Tackling the significant communication bottlenecks found in modern distributed computing infrastructures, exacerbated by data-intensive AI and machine learning workloads, I am committed to designing\textemdash as well as democratizing the design process for\textemdash scalable architectures that maximize the capabilities of integrated silicon photonics, bridging communication and computation. With a deeper integration of photonics within computing sockets, I envision a paradigm shift in computing architectures that promises unparalleled interconnection bandwidth density, versatility, and functionalities.
